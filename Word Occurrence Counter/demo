Sure, let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def count_word_occurrences(file_path):
   ```
   - This line defines a Python function called `count_word_occurrences`. It takes one argument, `file_path`, which should be a string representing the path to a text file.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   word_count = {}
   ```
   - Here, an empty Python dictionary named `word_count` is created. This dictionary will be used to store words as keys and their corresponding counts as values.

3. **Try-Except Block:**
   ```python
   try:
   ```
   - This is the start of a try-except block. It's used for error handling, so if something goes wrong when reading the file, it can be caught and handled.

4. **File Opening:**
   ```python
   with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
   ```
   - This line opens the file specified by the `file_path` variable for reading (`'r'` mode). It uses a `with` statement, which is a context manager in Python, to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading. The file is assigned to the `file` variable.

5. **Reading Line by Line:**
   ```python
   for line in file:
   ```
   - This `for` loop iterates through each line in the opened file. The variable `line` represents each line of text.

6. **Word Splitting:**
   ```python
   words = line.split()
   ```
   - Inside the loop, each `line` is split into words using the `split()` method. By default, it splits the line at spaces, creating a list of words in `words`.

7. **Word Processing:**
   ```python
   for word in words:
   ```
   - Another `for` loop is used to iterate through each `word` in the `words` list.

8. **Normalization:**
   ```python
   word = word.strip('.,!?()-"\'').lower()
   ```
   - For each `word`, leading and trailing punctuation characters (e.g., periods, commas, question marks) are stripped, and the word is converted to lowercase. This normalization ensures that words like "This" and "this" are treated as the same word.

9. **Word Counting:**
   ```python
   if word in word_count:
       word_count[word] += 1
   else:
       word_count[word] = 1
   ```
   - The code checks if the `word` is already in the `word_count` dictionary. If it is, the count for that word is incremented by 1. If it's not in the dictionary, a new entry is added with a count of 1.

10. **File Closing:**
    ```python
    file.close()
    ```
    - After processing the entire file, it's important to close it to release system resources.

11. **Output Display:**
    ```python
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        print(f'{word}: {count}')
    ```
    - Finally, the code iterates through the `word_count` dictionary and prints each unique word along with its count.

12. **Error Handling (Except Block):**
    ```python
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    ```
    - If any exceptions occur during the execution (e.g., the specified file is not found or another error occurs), this code will catch and handle them. It prints appropriate error messages.

13. **Function Call:**
    ```python
    file_path = 'sample.txt'
    count_word_occurrences(file_path)
    ```
    - Finally, the code calls the `count_word_occurrences` function with the `file_path` variable set to `'sample.txt'`. You should replace `'sample.txt'` with the actual path to your text file.

## **Conclusion** 
This Python program reads a text file, tokenizes it into words, normalizes the words (removing punctuation and converting to lowercase), and then counts how many times each unique word appears in the file. The results are displayed in the terminal.

- An OpenWeatherMap API key. You can sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/weather-forecast-app
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in `weather_app.py` with your OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```python
   api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   ```

## Running the Application

6. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

7. The GUI window will open. Enter the name of the city for which you want to see the 5-day weather forecast and click the "Search" button.

8. The application will display the forecast, including date, temperature, description, and an icon representing the weather conditions for each of the next 5 days.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter permission issues when upgrading pip or installing packages, you can run the command as an administrator or use a virtual environment. Refer to the "Permission Issues" section in this README for more details.

- To enhance the application further, consider adding more features or exploring advanced GUI libraries like PyQt or Kivy for a more sophisticated user interface.
